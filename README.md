# Programming Algorithms and Paradigms

## Introduction
This project focuses on the implementation of various algorithms and the exploration of programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven programming. The project also covers the process of building an application from writing an algorithm to executing it. Practical implementations of algorithms in Java are included, showcasing their application across different programming paradigms.

## Research Objectives
1. Implement basic algorithms using Java and analyze their performance.
2. Compare and contrast procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven programming paradigms through practical examples.
3. Understand and apply the debugging process in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop robust and secure applications.
4. Evaluate the importance of coding standards in software development, both individually and within a team setting.
5. Critically assess the relationship between written algorithms and their implementation in code.

## System Features
- **Binary to Decimal Converter**: A Java program that converts binary numbers into decimal format, implementing an algorithm for this process.
- **Procedural, Object-Oriented, and Event-Driven Programming**: Examples demonstrating the characteristics and relationships between these paradigms using Java.
- **IDE Management**: The use of an IDE to manage the development process, from writing and debugging code to execution.
- **Debugging and Coding Standards**: Explanation and implementation of debugging facilities in an IDE, with a focus on improving code robustness and security.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Eclipse or any other Java-compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Development Tools**: Git for version control, Java runtime for program execution

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of algorithms, programming paradigms, and the development process in Java. By focusing on procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven programming, it demonstrates the importance of choosing the right paradigm for different scenarios. The use of an IDE facilitates efficient debugging, improving the quality and security of the code. Additionally, adherence to coding standards ensures maintainability and teamwork in larger projects.
